# Simple Drag-and-Drop Website Builder

## What is this?

This is a basic website builder made with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can drag elements (text, image, button) from the sidebar onto the canvas, then click any element to edit its properties (like text, color, size, or image URL) in the form on the right. You can also delete any element from the canvas using the delete button in the properties panel.

## Features

- Drag and drop text, image, or button onto the canvas
- Edit properties of each element (text, font size, color, image URL, button background)
- Delete any element from the canvas
- Clean, simple, and mobile-friendly UI
- No frameworks or external libraries used

## How it works

- **Sidebar:** Drag elements from here to the canvas
- **Canvas:** Drop elements here to add them to your page
- **Edit Properties:** Click any element on the canvas to edit its properties or delete it
